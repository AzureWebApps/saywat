## not sure what they just said? ask us

*A simple service to help jump those cultural barriers.*

## About

Ever had a conversation with someone where they mention a word or phrase that just doesn't make sense? This is the site for you.

**saywat** is intended to help capture and share the idiosyncracies of various cultures so that others can follow conversations quickly.
While other sites do an excellent job of capturing and discussing latest trends, saywat is interested in the fundamentals and words and phrases in common use.

## Why?

Several reasons:

 - an excuse to learn nodejs - personally I always learn better when i can do something practical with new tools/languages/concepts.
 - the code will be OSS - hopefully it is useful as a learning tool
 - the site itself might actually be useful to others

## Examples

**wat** (noun, internet): a response to something that makes absolutely no sense.

**arvo** (noun, Australia): abbreviation for *afternoon*. Example: "will you be around this arvo?"

## Workflow

This is how the site could be used:

 - User spots a new word or phrase.
 - User adds request for understanding on site and lodges a question about it on the site. Provides some additional details - how it was used, the possible culture associated with it - to help provide context.
 - notification sent out (Twitter account?) so that users can follow new requests.
 - another user responds to the request
 - answer and question are captured for posterity

## What's next?

Read up on the site structure [here](/site).

I'll be mocking up some stuff and fleshing out this idea further over the next day or two. If you've got suggestions or feedback, ping me on [twitter](@shiftkey).

Alternatively, I help organise the [Code52](http://code52.org) gang - we have a JabbR [chatroom](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) if you want to hang out and discuss things in real-time.
